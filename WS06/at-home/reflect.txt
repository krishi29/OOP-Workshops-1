- Why do you need to deallocate the dynamically allocated memory in your vector?

The vector container is the closest relative to an array - since it stores contiguous data without the need of tracking what's before/after the index. 
However, vectors have the ability to handle its own destruction once the object goes out of scope.
 
- How can the function `loadData()` detect what went wrong? Can you think at another solution than the one you have implemented?

Vectors have the ability to deallocate when the object goes out of scope.

- How the range-based for simplifies coding in this case.
Instead of accessing via index , we don't need to worry about the index since the current element 
(the pointer to the element within the container itself) of the container is accessed via reference (&) in a range based for loop.
