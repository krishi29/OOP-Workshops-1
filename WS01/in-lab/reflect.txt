1. the difference between internal and external linkage using examples from your code.
- Internal linkage is used for the variables' scope that is itself's module, such as static variable. 
  External linkage is used for extern variable.

2. what are `static` variables and how were they useful in this workshop.
 - Static Variables are used to give special characteristics to an element. Static elements are allocated storage only once in a program lifetime in static storage area.
   And the scope of it is on in its module. 

3.The changes that you made in upgrading your `Event` class.
