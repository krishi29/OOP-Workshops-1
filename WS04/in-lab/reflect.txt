			Workshop 4 reflection
1. The difference between the implmentations of a composition and an aggregation
- Aggregation implies a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent
For example, Stock market company and their employees, delete the company and the 
employees still exist. Differently, composition implies a relationship where the child cannot
exist independent of the parent. 

2. The difference between the implementations of move and copy functions in a 
composition and an aggregation
- If a class with a resource is responsible for copying and destroying its resource, then
that class is a composition. If the class is not responsible for copying or destroying its
resource, then that class is an aggregation or an association.
